    aboutme:"I am Tanasia LaBrew, and I am a freelance Graphic Designer with a BFA in Graphic Design. I have experience in Web Design, UX/UI design, and Branding. I am detail oriented and can work well independently and as part of a team. I will work to find solutions to the best of my ability and I am always willing to learn new ways to work efficiently. In addition to freelance work I am currently working a part-time job while attending a coding bootcamp. I enjoy creating user friendly interfaces and excel with doing Front-End web development, mainly HTML, CSS, and React. Under pressure I remain calm and try to find efficient solutions to keep myself and my coworkers from facing massive amounts of stress. After graduating from the coding bootcamp I hope to use the skills I learned to find a full-time position in UX/UI design.",
